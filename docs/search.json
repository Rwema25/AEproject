    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe Alliance of Bioversity International and CIAT (ABC), in partnership with the McKnight Foundation and the African Institute of Mathematical Sciences (AIMS), is developing a Climate Data Toolkit to support agroecological (AE) research. The toolkit will empower researchers and practitioners to integrate climate data into their workflows, enabling robust analyses of agroecological systems under climate stresses and shocks. Rather than creating new datasets or analytical functions, this project will consolidate and simplify access to existing climate data resources, offering users a streamlined, user-friendly platform to support evidence-based decision-making.\nThis document is organized into several key sections to guide users through the Climate Data Toolkit. It begins with an overview of the climate datasets included, detailing their sources, variables, and formats. Next, it presents the climate indicators relevant to agroecological research, explaining their definitions and calculation methods. The following section outlines the prioritization methodology used to select and rank datasets and indicators based on research needs. Additional chapters provide information on the tools, scripts, and APIs integrated within the toolkit, along with practical guidance on applying the toolkit in real-world agroecological contexts. Finally, references and supplementary materials are included to support further exploration and use."

This approach enables global, climate-driven estimation of sowing dates for major crops.\n\n4.1.1 Step-by-Step Summary: Determining Sowing Dates\nThis summary outlines the methodology for simulating sowing dates of major crops under rainfed conditions, as described in the materials and methods section of Waha et al. (2019).\n\n\n4.1.2 Input Climate Data Preparation\n\nGather monthly temperature, precipitation, and number of wet days at 0.5° x 0.5° spatial resolution from the Climatic Research Unit dataset.\nGenerate daily mean temperatures by interpolating monthly means.\nDistribute daily precipitation using a weather generator that considers wet/dry day transitions.\n\n\n\n4.1.3 Climate Seasonality Classification\n\nCalculate annual variation coefficients for precipitation (CVprec) and temperature (CVtemp) from past monthly climate data, using an exponential weighted moving average (recent years weighted more heavily).\nClassify each location into one of four seasonality types:\n\nNo temperature and no precipitation seasonality\nPrecipitation seasonality\nTemperature seasonality\nBoth temperature and precipitation seasonality\n\nFor combined seasonality, check if the coldest month’s mean temperature is above 10°C (no cold season) or ≤10°C (cold season).\n\n\n\n4.1.4 Rule-Based Sowing Date Determination by Seasonality Type\n\nNo seasonality: Assign a default sowing date (January 1) for technical reasons.\nPrecipitation seasonality:\n\nIdentify the main wet season using the sum of precipitation-to-potential-evapotranspiration (P/PET) ratios over four consecutive months.\nSowing date is the first wet day (&gt;0.1 mm precipitation) in the main wet season.\n\nTemperature seasonality:\n\nSowing occurs when daily average temperatures exceed a crop-specific threshold (for spring crops) or fall below a threshold (for winter crops needing vernalization).\nThe sowing month is when the mean monthly temperature of the past exceeds (or falls below) the threshold; if the last day of the previous month already meets the threshold, that month is chosen.\n\nCombined seasonality:\n\nIf coldest month &gt;10°C, precipitation determines sowing (as above).\nIf coldest month ≤10°C, temperature determines sowing (as above).\n\n\n\n\n4.1.5 Crop-Specific Temperature Thresholds\n\nEach crop has a globally applied temperature threshold for sowing, based on literature and observed farmer practices.\nFor winter crops, the threshold ensures vernalization requirements are met.\n\n\n\n4.1.6 Validation\n\nSimulated sowing dates are compared with observed global data (MIRCA2000).\nFor most crops and regions, the difference between simulated and observed sowing dates is less than one month.\n\n\nReference:\n[1] Waha et al. (2019), “Climate-driven simulation of global crop sowing dates” (PDF)\n\n\n\n4.2 General Crop Modeling Methodologies\nThermal time / growing degree days (GDD) approaches are widely used to simulate crop phenology, where maturity is reached once accumulated heat units meet crop-specific thresholds.\nFor example, the Community Land Model (CLM) uses GDD accumulation to determine maturity dates (Olin et al., 2015;Jagermeyr et al., 2018; Rabin et al, 2023).\nRule-based methods also use climate seasonality, temperature thresholds, and soil moisture indices to estimate sowing and maturity dates (see refs: Mathison et al., 2018; Minoli et al., 2022).\n\nReferences:\n\nOlin, S., Schurgers, G., Lindeskog, M., Wårlind, D., Smith, B., Bodin, P., Holmér, J., and Arneth, A.

Nature Communications, 13, Article 7079. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-34411-5\n\n\n\n4.3 Other approach\nDifferent approaches are applied in existing crop models to determine current and future sowing dates. Crop models such as LPJmL (Bondeau et al., 2007) identify sowing dates from climate data and crop water and temperature requirements for sowing. The calculation procedure currently applied in LPJmL (Bondeau et al.,2007) is not applicable for all crops in different climatic regions and has only been evaluated for temperate cereals.\nAnother approach is to optimize sowing dates using the crop model by selecting the date which leads to the highest crop yield,a method applied, for example, in DayCent (Stehfest et al., 2007), or by selecting the optimal growing period based on pre-defined crop-specific requirements, as in GAEZ (Fischer et al.,2002).\nFinally, pre-defined sowing dates based on obser vations have been used, e.g. in the Global Crop Water Model (GCWM)(Siebert & Döll,2008) and in GEPIC (Liu et al.,2007).\nReferences:\n\nBondeau, A., Smith, P.

    "text": "5 Discussion on State-of-the-Art Approaches: Rainfall-Based vs NDVI-Based Seasonality Detection\nSeasonality detection plays a vital role in ecological monitoring, agricultural management, and climate studies. Two primary approaches are widely used: rainfall-based and NDVI-based methods, each with distinct data sources, strengths, and limitations.\n\n5.1 Comparison Table of Rainfall-Based and NDVI-Based Seasonality Detection\n\n\n\nAspect\nRainfall-Based Detection\nNDVI-Based Detection\n\n\n\n\nData Source\nPrecipitation measurements (rain gauges, satellites) 1\nSatellite-derived vegetation greenness index (NDVI) 2\n\n\nPrimary Focus\nHydrological inputs and rainfall patterns\nVegetation response and phenology 3\n\n\nDetection Method\nChange-point detection, threshold methods 4\nTime-series analysis of vegetation indices 5\n\n\nStrengths\nDirect measurement of rainfall; timely detection of season transitions 1,4\nCaptures biological/ecological response; useful over large spatial scales 2,3\n\n\nLimitations\nDoes not capture vegetation or ecological response; may miss lag effects\nInfluenced by other climatic factors; time lag between rainfall and vegetation response 3,5\n\n\nTime Lag Consideration\nGenerally immediate reflection of rainfall events\nVegetation response lags rainfall by weeks to months; lag varies by region and ecosystem 5\n\n\nApplications\nDefining rainy season onset/cessation; hydrological studies 1,4\nMonitoring vegetation dynamics; ecological and agricultural assessments 2,3\n\n\nComplementarity\nProvides physical season boundaries\nValidates and refines seasonality based on vegetation growth 2,5\n\n\n\n\n5.1.1 Rainfall-Based Seasonality Detection\nRainfall-based approaches utilize precipitation data to identify the onset, duration, and end of rainy seasons through statistical techniques such as change-point detection and threshold analysis. These methods provide direct and timely indicators of hydrological seasonality, which is critical in semi-arid and arid regions where rainfall governs water availability and crop cycles. However, rainfall data alone may not reflect the biological or ecological responses that follow precipitation events 1,4.\n\n\n5.1.2 NDVI-Based Seasonality Detection\nNDVI, derived from satellite remote sensing, measures vegetation greenness and is widely employed to infer seasonality by capturing vegetation phenology. NDVI strongly correlates with rainfall, especially during growing seasons, but the relationship is modulated by time lags, vegetation type, soil properties, and other climatic factors such as temperature and solar radiation. Time lags between rainfall and NDVI response can range from a few weeks to several months and vary spatially, necessitating advanced modeling approaches to accurately capture these dynamics 2,3,5.\n\n\n5.1.3 Integration and Complementarity\nIntegrating rainfall and NDVI data provides a more comprehensive view of seasonality by combining physical rainfall patterns with ecological vegetation responses. This integration improves the accuracy of seasonality detection and enhances understanding of ecosystem health and productivity under varying climatic conditions 2,5.\nReferences:\n[1] Shisanya, C.
