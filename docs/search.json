Those with the highest total scores were selected as core indicators for our climate data tool. This approach ensures that our indicator set is robust, actionable, and grounded in both science and practical application.\n\nIndicator Prioritization Matrix\nWe used a multi-criteria matrix to prioritize climate hazard indicators for inclusion in our climate data tool. Each indicator was scored from 1 (lowest) to 3 (highest) against the following criteria:\n\nRelevance to key agroecological hazards (drought, heat, waterlogging, compound events)\nScientific consensus and prevalence in literature/operational use\nCrop/livestock specificity (can thresholds be tailored?)\nData availability (open-access, spatial/temporal coverage)\nComputation feasibility (existing scripts, APIs, packages)\nImpact on management and decision-making\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndicator\nRelevance\nScientific Consensus\nCrop/Livestock Specificity\nData Availability\nComputation Feasibility\nManagement Impact\nTotal Score\nPriority\n\n\n\n\nSPI (Standardized Precipitation Index)\n3\n3\n1\n3\n3\n2\n15\nHigh\n\n\nSPEI (Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index)\n3\n3\n1\n3\n3\n2\n15\nHigh\n\n\nSoil Moisture Anomaly\n3\n2\n2\n2\n2\n3\n14\nHigh\n\n\nNTX (Number of Hot Days)\n3\n2\n2\n3\n2\n3\n15\nHigh\n\n\nTHI (Temperature Humidity Index, Livestock)\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n12\nMedium\n\n\nVPD (Vapor Pressure Deficit)\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n12\nMedium\n\n\nDays Soil Moisture &gt; Field Capacity\n2\n1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n11\nMedium\n\n\n\nEach criterion is scored from 1 (lowest) to 3 (highest).
