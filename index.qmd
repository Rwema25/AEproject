## Introduction

The Alliance of Bioversity International and CIAT (ABC), in partnership with the McKnight Foundation and the African Institute of Mathematical Sciences (AIMS), is developing a Climate Data Toolkit to support agroecological (AE) research. The toolkit will empower researchers and practitioners to integrate climate data into their workflows, enabling robust analyses of agroecological systems under climate stresses and shocks. Rather than creating new datasets or analytical functions, this project will consolidate and simplify access to existing climate data resources, offering users a streamlined, user-friendly platform to support evidence-based decision-making.

This document is organized into several key sections to guide users through the Climate Data Toolkit. It begins with an overview of the climate datasets included, detailing their sources, variables, and formats. Next, it presents the climate indicators relevant to agroecological research, explaining their definitions and calculation methods. The following section outlines the prioritization methodology used to select and rank datasets and indicators based on research needs. Additional chapters provide information on the tools, scripts, and APIs integrated within the toolkit, along with practical guidance on applying the toolkit in real-world agroecological contexts. Finally, references and supplementary materials are included to support further exploration and use.

## Climate datasets

This section systematically presents the climate datasets used in this study, covering their key characteristics, accessibility procedures, and their specific value for advancing agroecological research. The datasets were evaluated and prioritized based on criteria critical for agricultural applications, data integration, and scientific rigor ([Prioritization method](https://github.com/Rwema25/AE-project/wiki/Prioritization-Methodology)).

## Indicators

This section summarizes key climate hazards: drought, heat stress, waterlogging, and compound events, relevant to agroecological research and climate risk assessment. For each hazard, widely used indices and indicators are listed along with their calculation methods, interpretation thresholds (including crop or livestock specificity where applicable), data requirements, and available tools or scripts for computation. Compound hazards, such as simultaneous heat and drought, are also included, as they can amplify risks to crops and livestock. This resource is designed to help users select, calculate, and apply the most appropriate indices for climate risk analysis and decision support in agricultural systems.

## Prioritization Methodology

### Dataset Prioritization Methodology

To ensure the selection of optimal climate datasets for agroecological research, we apply a structured prioritization approach. This process evaluates datasets based on criteria critical for agricultural applications, data integration, and scientific rigor.

#### Prioritization Criteria

-   **Relevance to Agroecology**
    -   *Does the dataset include variables essential for crop modeling and agricultural risk assessment (e.g., precipitation, temperature, soil moisture, evapotranspiration)?*
-   **Spatial and Temporal Alignment**
    -   *Does the dataset’s spatial and temporal resolution meet the needs of farm-level or regional analysis (e.g., \<10 km spatial resolution, daily or sub-monthly time steps)?*
-   **Accessibility**
    -   *Is the dataset freely available for research use? Does it offer clear documentation and robust access methods (e.g., API, direct download, cloud platforms)?*
-   **Integration Potential**
    -   *Are there established tools, scripts, or packages (e.g., Python/R libraries, Google Earth Engine scripts) to facilitate data retrieval, preprocessing, and analysis?*
-   **Data Quality, Validation, and Uncertainty**
    -   *Has the dataset been peer-reviewed, validated against ground observations, or subject to uncertainty quantification? Is metadata comprehensive and transparent?*

#### Example Scoring Approach

| Criterion                  | Weight (%) | Score (1–5) | Weighted Score |
|----------------------------|------------|-------------|----------------|
| Relevance to Agroecology   | 30         | 5           | 1.5            |
| Spatial/Temporal Alignment | 20         | 4           | 0.8            |
| Accessibility              | 20         | 3           | 0.6            |
| Integration Potential      | 20         | 4           | 0.8            |
| Data Quality & Validation  | 10         | 4           | 0.4            |
| **Total**                  | **100**    |             | **4.1**        |

**Priority Level:**

**Formula:**\
`Weighted Score = (Weight as decimal) × Score`

-   **High:** Score ≥ 3.0 (Core dataset for agroecology)
-   **Medium:** 2.0 ≤ Score \< 3.0 (Supplementary or niche use)
-   **Low:** Score \< 2.0 (Limited utility for project)

#### Prioritized Dataset List

| Rank | Dataset | Weighted Score | Notes/Strengths |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| 1 | CHIRPS | 4.8 | Essential precip, high res, strong integration |
| 1 | AgERA5 | 4.8 | Key ag variables, high res, tailored for agriculture |
| 2 | TerraClimate | 4.7 | Water balance, high res, global, accessible |
| 2 | IMERG | 4.7 | High-res precip, global, accessible |
| 2 | TAMSAT | 4.7 | Africa-focused, very high res, accessible |
| 2 | CHIRTS | 4.7 | Essential temp, high res, strong integration |
| 3 | ERA5 | 4.2 | Broad variables, high res, strong integration |
| 4 | NEX-GDDP | 4.1 | Future projections, downscaled, accessible |
| 5 | NASA POWER | 4.0 | Solar, temp, global, but coarser res |
| 6 | CMIP6 | 3.9 | Future scenarios, coarser res, less direct for ag |

### Indicator Prioritization Methodology

Indicators were prioritized using a multi-criteria matrix, scoring each index on relevance to key hazards, scientific consensus, crop/livestock specificity, data availability, computation feasibility, and management impact. Those with the highest total scores were selected as core indicators for our climate data tool. This approach ensures that our indicator set is robust, actionable, and grounded in both science and practical application.

#### Indicator Prioritization Matrix

We used a multi-criteria matrix to prioritize climate hazard indicators for inclusion in our climate data tool. Each indicator was scored from 1 (lowest) to 3 (highest) against the following criteria:

-   **Relevance to key agroecological hazards** (drought, heat, waterlogging, compound events)
-   **Scientific consensus and prevalence** in literature/operational use
-   **Crop/livestock specificity** (can thresholds be tailored?)
-   **Data availability** (open-access, spatial/temporal coverage)
-   **Computation feasibility** (existing scripts, APIs, packages)
-   **Impact on management and decision-making**

| Indicator | Relevance | Scientific Consensus | Crop/Livestock Specificity | Data Availability | Computation Feasibility | Management Impact | Total Score | Priority |
|--------|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|
| SPI (Standardized Precipitation Index) | 3 | 3 | 1 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 15 | High |
| SPEI (Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index) | 3 | 3 | 1 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 15 | High |
| Soil Moisture Anomaly | 3 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 14 | High |
| NTX (Number of Hot Days) | 3 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 3 | 15 | High |
| THI (Temperature Humidity Index, Livestock) | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 12 | Medium |
| VPD (Vapor Pressure Deficit) | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 12 | Medium |
| Days Soil Moisture \> Field Capacity | 2 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 11 | Medium |

*Each criterion is scored from 1 (lowest) to 3 (highest). The total score is the sum across all criteria.*
